The Tri-Model Tournament: Revolutionising Cross-Team Collaboration in Data Science
The Tri-Model Tournament was born from a vision to transform how data scientists collaborate, innovate, and solve complex challenges. Unlike traditional hackathons, this week-long event emphasised camaraderie, cross-team creativity, and tackling real-world problems that extend beyond theoretical exercises.

What is the Tri-Model Tournament?
The Tri-Model Tournament is a hackathon-style event tailored for data scientists to refine predictive models by tackling a pressing challenge: assessing the likelihood of anomalous data points reported by banks to the Bank of England (BoE). Hosted by the Regulatory Data Group (RDG), this initiative brought together 18 data scientists across three experiment families. Each team worked on exploring unique problem-solving approaches within a shared dataset, fostering a blend of collaboration and friendly competition.

The name “Tri-Model Tournament” was inspired by the Triwizard Tournament from the Harry Potter series. While there were no dragons to battle or dark lords to resurrect, the name symbolised the spirit of friendly competition, the division into three experiment families, and the magical creativity required to push the boundaries of machine learning.

At its core, the tournament was about:

Discovery: Testing unexplored methodologies for anomaly detection.
Collaboration: Bridging knowledge gaps and building trust among diverse teams.
Innovation: Enhancing the predictive power of existing machine learning models.
Key Considerations in Planning
One of the most critical aspects of planning the Tri-Model Tournament was the distribution of resources across the experiment families. We prioritised achieving a good balance of gender and seniority within each team. This deliberate approach fostered diversity of thought, creating a dynamic environment where innovative solutions could emerge.

Additionally, the training and test datasets were of paramount importance. We devoted significant effort to ensuring a representative dataset at the start of the hackathon. However, one key lesson learned was the impact of data cleaning on the overall timeline. While some teams made considerable progress on experimentation, others had to invest time in cleaning the data. In future iterations, we aim to pre-clean datasets ahead of the event to enable more focused experimentation during the hackathon.

The Structure of the Tournament
The event was divided into three experiment families, each focusing on a specific avenue of exploration. Participants were encouraged to do exploratory data analysis (EDA) before finalising their experimental designs. Teams were deliberately diverse, featuring both senior and junior colleagues, ensuring a broad range of perspectives.

Experiment Family 1: Modelling Across Time-Series Types

Objective: Classify time-series data into types (e.g., stock or flow) and develop tailored models for each type.
Focus Areas:
Statistical properties like slope, standard deviation, and seasonality.
Advanced models, including LSTMs and random forests, designed for specific data properties.
Experiment Family 2: Modelling Across Banks or Bank Groups

Objective: Identify unique behavioural patterns across banks or groups of banks to improve anomaly detection.
Focus Areas:
Clustering approaches to empirically group banks.
Designing features based on statistical and behavioural patterns within each group.
Experiment Family 3: Modelling Across Templates or Template Groups

Objective: Understand and leverage patterns within templates or template families to enhance predictions.
Focus Areas:
Template-specific and group-level feature engineering.
Exploring structural patterns like data layout and statistical metrics.
Key Innovations Explored
To stimulate creativity, teams were provided with a comprehensive list of suggested features, including:

Logarithmic transformations for time-series data.
Indicators for pattern breaches (e.g., deviations from annual trends).
Features capturing volatility, stationarity, and behavioural patterns.
Additionally, reproducibility was a priority throughout the event. We ensured that every experiment, regardless of size, was accompanied by thorough documentation and metadata. Selected features and methodologies were recorded systematically, enabling smooth handovers and future use of these insights.

Promising Results
The concentrated efforts of 18 data scientists over the course of the week yielded amazingly promising results across all experiment families. These outputs will continue to fuel the development of our models and are likely to be incorporated into productionised systems.

The format of the Tri-Model Tournament proved its value by driving significant progress for the Change team, demonstrating the power of collaborative, time-bound innovation. Inviting such a large group of talented professionals to tackle shared challenges produced transformative results that would have taken much longer to achieve through regular workflows.

Outcomes and Lessons Learned
The Tri-Model Tournament was more than just a competition—it was an incubator for innovation and cross-functional learning. Key takeaways included:

Improved Models: Experiment families produced ensemble models and new features that significantly enhanced the robustness of predictions.
Broader Knowledge Sharing: A diverse mix of participants bridged knowledge silos, creating a more cohesive data science community.
Scalable Methodologies: The insights and models developed provide a solid foundation for tackling future challenges.
Future Focus: Pre-cleaning datasets ahead of the event will allow participants to dedicate more time to advanced experimentation.
Closing Thoughts
The Tri-Model Tournament exemplifies how structured, collaborative events can unlock the full potential of data science teams. By prioritising innovation, fostering cross-team collaboration, and addressing real-world challenges, this initiative provided a blueprint for other organisations looking to combine technical excellence with teamwork.

In the words of the organisers:
"May the best models emerge, and may the spirit of collaboration and learning guide us all."

✨ Here’s to a future of smarter models, stronger teams, and boundless innovation.
